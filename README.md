For this project, I decided to use Google Colab in order to see my graphs real time and access the statistical libraries I needed more easily, and to make it
easier to download the required libaries / modules for anyone viewing it. I was initially planning to convert my notebook to html via nbinteract, in order to
maintain interactivity, but due to GitHub's recent switch from 'master' to 'main' doing so via Binder kept having issues.

I uploaded my finished Google Colab notebook to my GitHub in a repository I made public. The address to the file is:

https://github.com/spikeyme/finalproject/blob/main/CS50ThornProject.ipynb

Please copy and paste that into your browser.
When you do so, click the 'Open in Colab' button that appears. The finished Colab notebook will then appear.
To start running the Python Code, click on the play buttons you see throughout the notebook, or hover over the numbers to reveal them..
Doing so the first time will prompt you to sign into a Google Account if you are not already.

After doing so, begin running the cells in the notebook by clicking the play buttons in order. There are 2 points where user input is required: the first is
when inputting the stock ticker that you choose. When you come to this, select a stock ticker from the Yahoo Finance website, and when prompted, enter the
ticker and then press shift, then run the next cell. Repeat this process when you are prompted to enter today's date: please do so in a Y-M-D format, press
enter, and then run the next cell.

When it comes to testing whether the notebooks are accurately collecting live data, please simply look at the most recent date in the 'Date1' column of any of
the timeseries, and then in 24 hours, check whether the date has updated.
